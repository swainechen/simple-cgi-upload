# simple-cgi-upload
This is a simple upload site I wrote years ago. This was pretty convenient for quick file transfers and sharing files (especially as an alternative to very large email attachments). It provides a simple interface to upload a single file and then gives you a shareable link.

This was written in perl and uses Apache for the web server, and I always ran it on Debian / Ubuntu (though it would need only minor if any modifications to run on other distributions / web servers).
